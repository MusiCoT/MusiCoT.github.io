[INTRO]
[VERSE]
I'm goin' down to where the fire is hot and dry
Goin' down on to my knees for you, dear Lord
If you come in, you won't find me easy prayin'
But I know you'll never leave
[CHORUS]
This time when I see him comin', won't he pass right over?
This time when I see him comin', he won't feel a thing
He's got such a way of taking all your love away
And he takes it and leaves you with a heart that's full of pain
[BREAK]
[CHORUS]
Cause this time when I see him comin', won't he pass right over?
This time when I see him comin', he won't feel a thing
He's got such a way of taking all your love away
And he takes it and leaves you with a heart that's full of pain
