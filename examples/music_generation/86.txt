[INTRO]
[VERSE]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
[CHORUS]
Cause you were always there
And I was never noticed
In a million places
But now you're here
[BREAK]
[VERSE]
Saying, "What's gone wrong with us?"
Don't you know we've changed?
A million reasons why
But in the end, it's only love
[CHORUS]
Love was out to get me
But now I'm out to get you
It began before we met
And will long after we're part
[OUTRO]
Cause you were always there
And I was never noticed
In a million places
But now you're here
And it doesn't even matter
