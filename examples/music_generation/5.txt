[INTRO]
[VERSE]
I saw your smile across the room
And my heart just went kaboom
Babe
You got that look in your eyes
Makes me feel like paradise
[CHORUS]
You're the one I'm dreaming of
When we're together
It's like fireworks above
Hold me close
Let's make this night our own
Midnight love
[VERSE]
Let's dance under the moonlit sky
In your arms
I just wanna fly
Honey
Your touch lights up the night
I feel the magic
It feels so right
[CHORUS]
You're the one I'm dreaming of
When we're together
It's like fireworks above
Hold me close
Let's make this night our own
Midnight love
[CHORUS]
You're the one I'm dreaming of
When we're together
It's like fireworks above
Hold me close
Let's make this night our own
Midnight love
