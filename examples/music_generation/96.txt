[INTRO]
[VERSE]
Every time I see a film, there's always the villain
And every time I look into my heart, it has no brain
But you're so easy to find, because I just point and say
Oh, look, there she is!
[CHORUS]
Cause now I'm in a girl band!
A girl band!
Yeah, yeah!
Girl band, oh!
[BREAK] 
[VERSE]
Oh, wait a minute!
My songs have always been about this kind of thing (thing)
Oh, but what if they were never gonna play it on TV?
Cause now I see your face
All around town with some loser
Well, how do you know I'm not one of them?
[CHORUS]
Cause now I'm in a girl band!
A girl band!
Yeah, yeah!
Girl band, oh!
