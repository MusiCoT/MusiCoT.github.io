[INTRO]
[VERSE]
Your love
Like Armani to my cotton dress
Got me standing still at the club on Sunday nights
Cashmere from L.A
Hooked on your style
Easy love
Help me adore
Just for a while
[CHORUS]
Ooh
I've got a crush on you
Baby
Your lips
So fine
You know it's true
Got it made in every single line
I've got a crush on you
[BREAK]
[VERSE]
Baby
When you're high
Sky is blue
Heart is clean
The best advice they gave me
Don't look down below
Nobody else could make me feel this way
Remember how you caught my eye
That fateful day
[CHORUS]
Ooh
I've got a crush on you
Baby
Your lips
So fine
You know it's true
Got it made in every single line
I've got a crush on you
