[INTRO] 
[VERSE]
Last night I didn't sleep at all
While gazing by your picture on the wall
I took each tear and dried it with my kiss
And saved the last for when you come to visit
[CHORUS]
And so I'm sending you this white Christmas
I hope it will bring you lots of cheer
Remember, darling, to listen to Santa Claus
He knows where you are
[BREAK] 
[VERSE]
Foolish boy, I shouldn't have let you go
It's no use pretending I don't care
But darling please remember, before you go
That I love you more than anyone
[CHORUS]
So I'm sending you this white Christmas
I hope it will bring you lots of cheer
Remember, darling, to listen to Santa Claus
He knows where you are
