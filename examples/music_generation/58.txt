[INTRO]
[VERSE]
Walking down the crowded streets
Neon lights shining bright
Heart beating like a drum
Lost in the city tonight
Every corner I turn
Unfamiliar faces passing by
But I'll keep on searching
Till I find my piece of the sky
[BREAK]
[VERES]
Gazing at the towering buildings
Feeling so small in this place
But I won't let it break me
I'll find my own space
The hustle and bustle
The rhythm of the city's song
I'll dance to my own beat and prove them all wrong
[Chorus]
Lost in the city
But I won't let it break my soul
Gonna find my way
Gonna take control
In this concrete jungle
I'll find my destiny
Lost in the city
But I know who I'm meant to be
