[INTRO]
[VERSE]
Sippin' on the stars
We're feeling so right
No need to worry
Just let go tonight
Underneath the moonlight
We're taking flight
In this endless summer night
We're gonna shine so bright
[VERSE]
Barefoot on the sand
We dance in the glow
Every moment feels like forever
Don't you know?
The air is filled with magic
Our spirits start to grow
In this endless summer night
Our love begins to show
[BREAK]
[CHORUS]
We're living for tonight
No worries
Just delight
In this endless summer night
We're gonna shine so bright
The rhythm takes us higher
We're soaring to new heights
In this endless summer night
We're gonna shine so bright
