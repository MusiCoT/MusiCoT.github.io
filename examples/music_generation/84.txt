[INTRO]
[VERSE]
You must be in love with me
For all of this to make sense
If you really loved me, baby, why would we fight?
When our days start at night? 
[CHORUS]
I'm doing my best to be in control 
But it's all so blurry when I'm near your mistletoe
And if I saw myself kissing you
Would I still run away? 
[BREAK]
[VERSE]
I said, "Darling, where'd you get those lips?"
You say, "That's what my mama told me"
No matter how much time goes by
The only answer is goodbye
[CHORUS]
I'm doing my best to be in control 
But it's all so blurry when I'm near your mistletoe
And if I saw myself kissing you
Would I still run away?
